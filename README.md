# PRGProject
Miss. Raheal is running a catering service “Delicious-Catering”. Her food is very famous in Gauteng. 
People order food from her for different events namely baptism, wedding, year-end function, birthday 
(with and without theme) parties etc. Usually, she takes booking directly from the client. Due to the 
current pandemic situation, she can’t directly take the booking. This is making her think about an online 
booking system for her catering service. 
She takes only one booking per day. She caters food at the venue. If any client requests to decorate 
the venue she does that according to client’s recommended theme. Once the booking has taken place 
she gives a booking number. The client can confirm the booking by 15 days prior to the event by giving 
50 % of the calculated total price. If the total number of people is above 40 there is a 15% discount 
from the calculated total adult's meal price. The client can update the selected food menu before 
booking confirmation. 
As a software engineering student, you are assigned to develop a booking system for her. She usually 
asks a few questions to the client during the booking. It is mandatory from her side to include a few 
questions to which the client can answer easily. Questions are given below in the form of requirements.
Basic requirements are : 
The client must be able to register into the system with required details such as name, surname 
and phone number etc. The client should be able to answer the questions.
Her basic questions are:
1. Type of event? Wedding/ birthday parties etc.
2. Event date and time? (The system must check the availability of the date.)
3. Event venue address? Capture details including phone number
4. The total number of people? How many kids and adults?
5. Food- selection from the menu (Adults Meal- Kids Meal- Drinks- Dessert etc.) 
6. Any decorations? If the answer is yes ask additional questions.
Miss. Raheal should be able to see all her bookings, see all confirmed/non confirmed bookings 
etc. She prefers the proposed system must generate a booking number so the client can check 
the status of the booking or can update the menu. 
The system must send a notification to the client once the booking is confirmed by Miss. 
Rachael. She also expecting a notification if the client makes any changes in the order.
Miss. Raheal could come up with only the above requirements. As a software developer, you have to 
identify the missing information and incorporate it during application development and then make 
the system more functional and user friendly. 
Develop the solution for the above scenario in two phases. 
Phase 1 [30]
In phase 1 analyse the scenario and identify the required business logic classes, 
interface, abstract classes etc. Create the Business Logic Layer and Data Access Subject: Programming 3X1
Assessment: Project
Total: 70 Marks

Layer with relevant classes and class members which will fulfil the functional 
requirements. As a group, you are to collaborate on this project in order to 
demonstrate Version Control in VS Code, using Git and GitHub. You are to create a 
single GitHub account, which all members of your group will access from their 
personal Git wrokspaces and collaborate to demonstrate Version Control. Members 
should be able to make commits and send pull and push requests to and from the 
GitHub repository, and you can assign a unique name to the repository (name should 
ressemble yourself as a group). On this repository, make sure you have two 
branches, Master and Develop branches. Each branch should contain a Multi 
Layered Architecture of your project, which should include your Business Logic 
Layer and Data Access Layer files for phase 1. Make sure you work on your develop 
branch first, before merging to your master branch. Include the url of your 
repository and submit on a word file, together with your solution for Phase 1.
Phase 2 [40]
In phase 2 develop the complete solution with Presentation Layer. You are to 
include the Presentation Layer into your Master and Develop branches on your 
repository. Make sure you work on your develop branch first, before merging to 
your master branch. You are again supposed to Include the url of your repository 
and submit on a word file, together with your solution for Phase 2.
